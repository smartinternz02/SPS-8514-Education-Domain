Further, the management course has its stand at the helm as any position in the career finally culminates in administration of management. Hence, no specific mention is needed for acquiring additional academic distinction by the technocrats for highly successful career. In view of the recession trends across the globe, IT &amp; CSE and other software professional invariably pursuing MBA as extension of their career may result as strong competitive arena to other non engineering students pursuing the same field as their career. Hence non-engineering management students have to strengthen their skills both academic &amp; managerial, to spinout of cutthroat &amp; stringent competition posed by surrounds in their employment career.<\/p>"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"},{"id":"37fbaba","settings":[],"elements":[{"id":"78557bb2","settings":{"_column_size":100,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"648c5468","settings":{"title":"Vision and Mission\n"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"heading","elType":"widget"},{"id":"33721f31","settings":{"structure":"20"},"elements":[{"id":"65ba6dae","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"7af0c3e","settings":{"title":"Vision of the Department","size":"medium"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"heading","elType":"widget"},{"id":"243bd45e","settings":{"editor":"<p>Providing excellence in education to build a better tomorrow, through a realistic and research oriented environment.<\/p>"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"column"},{"id":"2f111e70","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"53f7ee04","settings":{"title":"Mission of the Department","size":"medium"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"heading","elType":"widget"},{"id":"492bfcf3","settings":{"editor":"<ul><li>To offer high quality Masters in Business Administration and to prepare students for professional career.<\/li><li>To contribute towards societal development through imparting quality education.<\/li><\/ul>"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"section"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}],"page_settings":{"hide_title":"yes"}}
